# LudoDB

Our app only needs to run on a local host so SQLite is a good choice in that aspect because it is easy to learn. 

At the moment a direct search path in DbContext is needed to run the project.

Also a lot of third-party tools can be used with SQLite to make a developers life easier. 

The following table shows a summary of some pros and cons with SQLite.

| `SQLite Pros`           | `SQLite Cons`                                         | 
| :-------------:         |:-------------:                                        | 
| Lightweight             | Restricted Database Size                              | 
| Fast                    | Can only handle low to medium traffic HTTP requests.  |
| Reliable                |                                                       |
| No Installation Needed  |                                                       |
