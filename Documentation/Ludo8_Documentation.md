### For the database we used SQLite. Because we're making a lightweight app SQLite is perfect. Our app does not take up a lot of memory, so a heavier database would only cost more processing power and slow down the app. Our app only needs to run on a local host so SQLite is a good choice in that aspect because it is easy to learn. Also a lot of third-party tools can be used with SQLite to make a developers life easier. The following table shows a summary of some pros and cons with SQLite.

| `SQLite Pros`           | `SQLite Cons`                                         | 
| :-------------:         |:-------------:                                        | 
| Lightweight             | Restricted Database Size                              | 
| Fast                    | Can only handle low to medium traffic HTTP requests.  |
| Reliable                |                                                       |
| No Installation Needed  |                                                       |
| Portable                |                                                       |
