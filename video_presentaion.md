# Video presentation

Do a video presentation of you project which explains your product, important features of your code and the process you have been through while developing your product.

The video should be some graphical presentation combined with a voice track. 

The video should have a max length of 30 minutes. Everybody in the group should have min 5 minutes of fame, in the sense that though out the video should each team member talk for at least a total of min 5 minutes, make it clear every time you change speaker.

The final movie should be a single file in the MP4 format and should be uploaded to Steam in the channel :  [Data√•tkomst Ludo game](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/8a73d6ce-dbe0-4178-8a07-5058c6013142) (which everybody hopefully have access to), include your group number in the description.

Release your creativity.

## Content of video

Focus in the video should be the following (it does not need to be in this order):

* A walkthrough of the thoughts behind the solution
  * Diagrams is a good thing
* A demo of the application running, it could be a video or screenshots
* Important parts of the code
  * Parts of the code you are proud of
  * Cool patterns / frameworks that you have used
  * Especially useful codereview comments
* A description of your process
  * Which tools did you use and for what?
  * How did the team communicate?
  * Did you part up your work in the team? And how?
* Lessons learnt during the process
  * What would you had done differently?

## Tools

There is no requirements to which tools you use, but a suggestions is to use the build-in recording functionality in **PowerPoint**, which makes it possible add a sound track (and video) to a presentation.  You could do screenshot of your code and put it into slides.

Screen recoding can be done directly in PowerPoint (see below). You can also use an external tool as the open-source tool [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/), [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download) or any commercial tool (it's properly possible find a free trail). 

## Hint

Do a first version of the presentation video early in the process. To get a simple idea on what do present in the video and get familiar with the tool.
